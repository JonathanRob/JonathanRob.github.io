	<h2>Most of the time, it leads to more questions.</h2>

	<p>But these questions come from a greater understanding. A deeper understanding of living systems is necessary to improve our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. Molecular-level data characterizing such systems are being generated at an increasing rate, but the data can be difficult to interpret due to its size and complexity. With increasing frequency, we have the data but lack the tools to use it effectively. The aim of my research is to develop and apply computational approaches to improve the extraction of information from biological data.</p>
