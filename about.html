		<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology (<a href="https://www.sysbio.se/">SysBio</a>), which is part of the Biology and Biological Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

		<p>I was born in Burlington, Vermont, but grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado. I received a B.S. in Chemical & Biological Engineering and a B.S. in Chemistry from Colorado State University in 2010. During my time at Colorado State, I had the opportunity join a <a href='http://qspt.colostate.edu/'>research group</a> led by Arthur Mayeno and Brad Reisfeld. Working with them inspired me to pursue a graduate degree, and in 2016 I was awarded a Ph.D. in Chemical & Biological Engineering from Princeton University, under the supervision of <a href="https://brynildsenlab.princeton.edu/">Mark Brynildsen</a>. Near the end of my Ph.D. I met Jens Nielsen during his visit to give a seminar at Princeton. Soon after, I joined his group in Sweden as a postdoc.</p>

		<p>When I'm not in lab, I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, learning Swedish, coding, and traveling.</p>
