        <p>I am a Scientific Data Developer at the <a href="https://bii.dk/">BioInnovation Institute</a> (BII) in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
		
        <p>I am a bioinformatics scientist at <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx">Chalmers University of Technology</a> in Gothenburg, Sweden, where I work as a member of <a href="https://nbis.se/">NBIS</a> (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden), which is a part of <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a> (Science for Life Laboratory).</p>

		<p>I was born in Burlington, Vermont, but grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado. I received a B.S. in Chemical & Biological Engineering and a B.S. in Chemistry from Colorado State University in 2010. During my time at Colorado State, I had the opportunity join a <a href='http://qspt.colostate.edu/'>research group</a> led by Arthur Mayeno and Brad Reisfeld. Working with them inspired me to pursue a graduate degree, and in 2016 I was awarded a Ph.D. in Chemical & Biological Engineering from Princeton University, under the supervision of <a href="https://brynildsenlab.princeton.edu/">Mark Brynildsen</a>. Near the end of my Ph.D., I met Jens Nielsen during a visit he made to Princeton for a seminar. Soon after, I joined <a href="https://www.sysbio.se/labs/nielsen/">his group</a> in Gothenburg, Sweden as a postdoc for four years.</p>

		<p>At the start of 2020, I joined <a href="https://nbis.se/">NBIS</a> (National Bioinformatic Infrastructure Sweden), which is a part of <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a> (Science for Life Laboratory), as a bioinformatics scientist. While at NBIS, I worked on projects with research groups throughout Sweden, in addition to teaching workshops and continuing to learn and develop new methods in computational biology and bioinformatics.</p>

        <p>After a year at NBIS, I was offered a position at BII in Copenhagen, Denmark. As a Scientific Data Developer at BII, I am responsible for their data analysis and management infrastructure efforts, which aim to support early-stage life science start-up companies with heavy data or computation needs.</p>

		<p>When I'm not in lab, I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, learning languages (Swedish and Finnish), coding, and traveling.</p>
